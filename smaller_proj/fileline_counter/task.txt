   Task: Build a File Line Counter with Error Handling

   Create a program that:

     - Takes multiple filenames as command-line arguments
     - For each file, counts and prints the number of lines
     - Handles all errors properly (file not found, permission denied, read errors)
     - Logs errors to stderr with meaningful messages including the program name
     - Uses standard errno codes and prints human-readable error messages
     - Exits with appropriate exit codes (0 for success, 1 if any file failed)
     - Flushes output at appropriate times
     - Checks for stream errors after operations

   Example run:

     ./linecount file1.txt file2.txt nonexistent.txt

   Expected behavior:

     - Print line counts to stdout for successful files
     - Print errors to stderr for failed files
     - Use ferror() to detect read problems
     - Return proper exit code based on overall success/failure

   Additional things you should know:

     - perror() and strerror(): Functions to convert errno to human-readable messages
     - Buffer management: When mixing stdout/stderr, consider when buffering matters
     - FILE operations*: fopen(), fclose(), fgets() or getc() for reading
     - Exit codes convention: 0 = success, non-zero = failure (typically 1 for general errors)
     - argc validation: Always check if argc >= 2 before accessing argv[1]

   Start coding! Focus on proper error checking at every step.
